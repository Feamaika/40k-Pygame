# My 40k Pygame
A simple pygame inspired by the Warhammer 40k tabletop rules I grew up playing, initially to practice concepts like class inheritance.
The rules follow the 4<sup>th</sup> edition ruleset.
Currently the game opens as a grid with each unit (squad, vehicle or monster) appearing on a single random square. Actions per turn are restriced and reset on a new turn (although currently all units can move in anyone's turn, and there's no restriction on the distance moved).
You click on a unit on the grid to see unit composition and completed actions in the output window. You can move with the arrow keys, and attack an enemy unit by right-clicking. It then rolls and deals damage automatically and provided description in the output window too.
